# Configure loopback interface (required for proper system operation)
auto lo                 # 'auto' means this interface will be brought up automatically during boot
iface lo inet loopback  # Configure as a loopback interface with IPv4

# Configure Ethernet interface
auto eth0               # Start eth0 automatically at boot
iface eth0 inet manual  # 'manual' means bring up the interface but don't configure IP
                        # This allows DHCP client (udhcpc) to handle IP configuration
